# Plant Buddy API overview

Keep your plants healthy and happy! Plant Buddy is a simple cloud-based REST API service for users to track and manage the care of their plants.

Plant Buddy has two resources: plants and carelogs. Adding a plant to the database takes only a minute. Then, whenever you tend to your plant, such as watering or fertilizing it, you can easily document the activity by creating a carelog for it. Carelogs help you monitor the health and growth of your plants over time so you can identify any emerging issues.

Developers can apply their own branding and integrate additional services to the app. With some modifications, Plant Buddy is also great for integrating into any app that could benefit from users being able to create and store logs for their belongings.
